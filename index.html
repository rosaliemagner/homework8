<h1>Homework 8: Historic Shoreline in Coastal Flooding Area</h1>

<h2>Research Question</h2>
<p>This project uses vector geoprocessing analysis to answer the following real-world question: How much of New Jersey's historic shoreline is in a coastal flooding area?</p>

<!-- Pre-work Discussion -->
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I downloaded shapefile data that displayed the historic shoreline in New Jersey and the coastal flooding areas from the last 100 years.</p><br>


<!-- Discussion of methods and presentation of results -->
<h2>Methods and Results</h2>
<p>I used the geoprocessing tool "dissolve" to combine the coastal flooding areas in the same zones, getting rid of unnecessary boundary lines. I used the geoprocessing tool "intersection" to determine the areas of the historic shoreline that intersect with coastal flooding area boundaries from the last 100 years.</p><br>
